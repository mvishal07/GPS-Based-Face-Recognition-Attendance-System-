The "GPS-based Face-recognition Attendance System" performs the function of recording 
feminine students’ attendees with the help of geographical location information and facial 
coordination. Such a system takes the coordinator in charge of monitoring whether the 
student is within the designated area for class attendance and whether that student is really 
who he or she claims to be in person. Flask is the backend framework and the student’s 
information is stored in the MySQL database.
